 - Make text variables uniform/ change text rendering method

Useful regex-expressions:

--------------------------------
private int location_(.*);

protected UniformMatrix $1 = new UniformMatrix("$1");
------------------------------------
super.loadInt\(location_(.*), (.)\);
to
$1.loadTexUnit($2);
